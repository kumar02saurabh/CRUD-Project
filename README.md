CRUD is an incredibly important idea,Standing for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, Acronym for Generate, Access, Modify, and Remove.


First we decide Schema in models , then write all the logic in controllers and than give to the Routes to decide the path.

In CRUD,
The "C" stands for Create,

which is the process of adding new information to a database.
The ability for users to enter data into an application depends on this function. 
The Create operation starts the process of growing the dataset inside an application, 
whether it's adding a new product to an e-commerce database, uploading a file to a cloud storage service,
or adding a new user to a social networking platform.


Read

Users are able to obtain pre-existing data from a system by using read, the "R" in CRUD.
The main focus of this process is retrieving previously saved data.
Whether a user is browsing a contact list in a messaging app, accessing a product catalog on an e-commerce website, or retrieving their personal information from a social networking platform, showing content to consumers requires reading data.


Update

The "U" in CRUD refers for Update, which is the process of changing data that is already present in a system. Users can alter or revise information as needed with this procedure. 
The Update action gives users the ability to modify their data, be it a user's password, a product's quantity in an inventory system, or the specifics of a blog post.


Delete

Lastly, the "D" in CRUD stands for Delete, which is the process of eliminating current data from a system. Users can use this function to remove data that is no longer relevant or needed. Users can clean up their data by using the Delete operation, 
which lets them remove items from document management systems, remove contacts from address books, and remove posts from social media feeds.
